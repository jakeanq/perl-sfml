TODO

- [HIGH] Add in EXPORT_OK stuff and related
- [MED ] Split XS into multiple modules
- [MED ] Add XS for audio module
- [HIGH] Add more tests

So far, only the Window and Graphics modules of SFML has been implemented.

The Audio module is coming (hopefully) (maybe) pretty soonish.  Feel free to
pester me for it if you really want it.

The System and Network modules have not and *will not* be implemented
due to their functions being pretty similar to existing perl modules
that do the same job just as well.  If you feel the need for the use
of one of these modules, you will need to follow these few simple steps:
	1) Clone the project on Github
	2) Add in the required code
	3) Send me a pull request
	4) Wait for the merge to be merged
	5) Install and use the modules!
