INSTALLATION

This module should work on any system that SFML does, including but
not limited to:
	Linux
	MacOSX
	Windows

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

SFML 2.0 RC - ***INSTALL THIS BEFORE THE PERL MODULE***
	WARNING: This module does not have an Alien:: counterpart and
	so you will need to handle the installation of SFML yourself.
	(Feel free to submit an Alien::SFML module of course!)
A windowing environment (the module may install without one, but you
	do so at your own risk)
OpenGL/POGL (if you want to be able to render stuff using raw OpenGL
	commands.  Once the graphics module is implemented, this
	should just work anyway.

TODO

- [HIGH] Add in EXPORT_OK stuff and related
- [MED ] Split XS into multiple modules
- [MED ] Add XS for graphics and audio modules

So far, only the Window module of SFML has been (mostly) implemented.

The Graphics and Audio modules are coming (hopefully) pretty soonish.

The System and Network modules have not and *will not* be implemented
due to their functions being pretty similar to existing perl modules.
If you desperatly feel the need for the use of one of these modules,
you will need to follow these few simple steps:
	1) Clone the project on Github
	2) Add in the required code
	3) Send me a pull request
	4) Wait for the merge to be merged
	5) Install and use the modules!
